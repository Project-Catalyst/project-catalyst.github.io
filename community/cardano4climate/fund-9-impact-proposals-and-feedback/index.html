That can include anything from rehabilitation centers for substance abuse to shelters, case management centers, street outreach programs, transitional housing, and many other approaches. Our goal is not to solve the whole homeless crisis, but to focus on one solution and educate the public about that specific approach.  As of now, we have partnered with a transitional housing organization, Uncle Dave's Housing, which focuses on helping men from South Central LA transition back into permanent housing. Transitional housing is an essential step that many have to take before transitioning back into permanent housing. Mike, a manager at the organization describes the process in four steps: Enter a rehab program Complete program Enter into transitional housing Enter back into permanent housing  Each one of the steps is a journey of its own and we would like to educate the public on this process and also bring awareness to this organization and organizations like it.  Uncle Dave's Housing charges $600/month to those seeking transitional housing. Usually, their tenants are individuals who come from rehab centers that just completed a program, were recently incarcerated, or are veterans. These men have nowhere else to go and could easily become homeless due to their situation. We want to ensure those individuals don't end up on the streets because they couldn't afford transitional housing.  NFT Breakdown 500 NFTs at $100 each for a total of $50,000 in sales =&gt; 16 recipients will each receive 5 months of housing paid for We will let the community decide what to do with the remaining $2,000 can go towards providing clothing, shoes, etc. High-Level Summary  Conduct interviews of success stories that have either lived or are currently living at Uncle Dave's Housing. We will also interview the organizers of the organization. After each interview will conduct a documentary-style photoshoot using a film camera The film pictures will then be scanned and turned into NFTs which will be sold to raise funds for the organization The NFTs will be embedded with re-sale royalties of 20%, this is a step taken to ensure that the organization (Uncle Dave's Housing) continues to benefit from any secondary sales. AirDrop of an update NFT will be made to holders at the end of the campaign   NFT PROTOTYPES  Image File   Summary Expanded  These are just prototypes but they help to illustrate our vision. We want to tell a story through an image that is also accompanied by video content. For example, we already conducted an interview with Mike where he tells his experience being homeless and how he managed to transition back into permanent housing. We will produce one of our first NFTs on Mike and share his story with the world. You can think of Mike and the other 15 success stories as sponsors.  The proceeds from his NFT collection will be dedicated to one individual who receives 5 months' worth of rent at Uncle Dave's Housing. Once we find a recipient who gets the free housing, we will conduct a short interview to hear their story and share it with the rest of the world. A new NFT will be made that corresponds with to recipient's story. The new batch of NFTs will be airdropped to the NFT holders  For Example: If Mike's NFT collection raises funds to house 'Bob' for 5 months, all the holders of Mike's NFT will be airdropped a new NFT that tells Bob's story.  Mike won't be the only individual we make our original NFTs based on. We will conduct interviews on 15 other success stories and each will sponsor one recipient to get free housing for 5 months. They will be sponsoring through the stories that they share. Through this whole process, we will share our progress with the community   NFT Utility  Our mission with this NFT project is to raise funds to help with the homeless crisis in LA. Thus, our marketing campaign will focus on attaining the empathy of the NFT community. We will make it clear through our marketing that this is a donation so the NFT holder should not expect a monetary return. Instead, the NFT holder will get to be part of a social impact project. It will allow holders to be a part of a community that is focused on giving.  Holders will have more tangible evidence of their NFT utility when we begin to do the AirDrop updates. For these updates, we will revisit the organization and show tangible proof that the funds from the NFT sale went towards housing those in need. After the airdrops, we will then send all NFT holders a physical copy of the film picture. This film picture will be produced by hand in a dark room.  Finally, there is the utility of tax deductions. Uncle Dave's Housing is a 501(c)(3) which means any contributions to the organization are tax-deductible. The NFT proceeds will be directed straight to the organization's wallet which qualifies the original purchaser to receive a tax deduction receipt. We will embed this into the smart contract and ensure that only the original buyers receive the tax deduction receipt. (This utility is only applicable to US purchasers)   End Result The funds will be used to pay 5 months' worth of rent for 16 men who are in danger of becoming homeless. That means 16 fewer people who end up on the streets. That means 16 more people who are able to transition back into permanent housing.  The community will get to see the tangible end results that came from their contributions. And the public at large will be better informed about the homeless crisis, the journey back into permanent housing, and organizations like Uncle Dave's Housing.   Beneficiaries  The group that benefits the most from this project will be those 16 men who are provided free housing for almost half a year. The second group to benefit will be Uncle Dave's Housing, through the royalties.</td> <td></td> <td>angeldominguez1799</td> <td>https://discord.gg/BUVzaaTq</td> <td>@sheltersblock</td> <td>Instagram: sheltersontheblock</td> <td></td> <td>Not applicable: I am the proposer/co-proposer (skip to next section)</td> <td></td> <td>Los Angeles has the highest homeless rate in the U.S. and has the second-largest homeless population.
