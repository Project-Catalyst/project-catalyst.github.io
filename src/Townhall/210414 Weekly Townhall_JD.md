| 00:00   | **Apologies for delay in funds**                                                                                                                                                                          | General Information | All                      |
|            | Big apologies by Dor and the team for delay: Unfortunately, there was a little bit delay in distributing the rewards of fund 3 and registration for fund 4 will be delayed slightly<br>               |                     |                          |
|            | Reason: Despite working effortlessly, Dor and the team couldn’t keep up 100% with scaling up to the biggest decentralized innovation fund in the world                                                |                     |                          |
| 02:46  | **West African Decentralized Alliance (WADA)**                                                                                                                                                       | Proposal Update     | All                      |
|            | West African Decentralized Alliance (WADA), Megan Hess and Fotio Manfo<br>Thanks to great community support they are currently being funded (50 people donated for WADA after a Cardano Live Podcast) |                     |                          |
|            | Current Mission: Connecting African developers to the Cardano blockchain with 3 pillars: Education, dapp creation and infrastructure                                                                  |                     |                          |
|            | Currently starting different hubs in West Africa                                                                                                                                                      |                     |                          |
| 09:27   | **Currently proposals are either granted 100% or 0% of funds**                                                                                                                                            | Problem Sensing     | All                      |
|            | It is problematic to manage for how much funding a proposal should apply – some people make cheaper proposals on purpose                                                                              |                     |                          |
|            | Currently it is just all or nothing – as a consequence – some proposals miss out because they requested only a bit too much                                                                           |                     |                          |
|            | There should be a the possibility to a) indicate ranges that would be okay for funding (e.g. 10.000-15.000$) and b) indicate if the proposers would be willing to work even if they don’t get funded  |                     |                          |
|            | Furthermore, there could be a donation round right after the funding round for the proposals that slightly missed the threshold                                                                       |                     |                          |
| 15:20   | **F3 Rewards have been sent out**                                                                                                                                                                         | General Information | vCA, CA, Voter, Proposer |

|            | 1 ada voting rewards were sent out to everybody who participated, even when they were only egligable for less. This will change next round.                                                           |                     |                          |

|            | Today starts fund 5 refinement stage – there are +/- 266 active proposals in fund 5                                                                                                                   |                     |                          |
|            | Now is the time to reduce the active proposals to better address the wicked problems                                                                                                                  |                     |                          |
|            | Use this phase for team building, use tags on the discord channel (that other people see which people you are seeking in your proposal)                                                               |                     |                          |
