# Expert ballots
These are community made voting guides with the intention of help voters organize their votes. There is no format necessary for an expert ballot. You may become known for creating expert ballots that focus on a specific aspect, or cover all proposals from a statistical view point. You may create long written examinations of proposals or you may offer data sorted in along a particular way. If you would like more information about creating an expert ballot please reach out in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/gsG8V7uZPG).
